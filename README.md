# Masked Mystery
> This project is a cleaner version of [this](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2026/masked-mystery-6) Global Game Jam 2026 game submission.

🎭 4 friends, one masquerade party, one dies. Who did it? Play the detective who solves the mystery. You have 1 room, 3 masks, 3 suspects, and one is the killer. 
🎭 Putting on each suspect's mask allows you to see the room from their perspective. Use the clues from each to find out who the killer is. Be careful though, everything isn’t what it seems. And try not to take too long.
